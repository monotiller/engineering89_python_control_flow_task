# Control flow task
We were given the following pseudo code:

## Movie Ratings!
As a user I should be able to ask the user for the a rating, and receive back the appropriate response:

- check for rating for this movie:
    - universal -> everyone can watch
    - pg --> General viewing, but some scenes may be unsuitable for young children
    - 12 -->  Films classified 12A and video works classified 12 contain material that is not generally suitable for children aged under 12. No one younger than 12 may see a 12A film in a cinema unless accompanied by an adult.
    - 15 --> No one younger than 15 may see a 15 film in a cinema.
    - 18 --> No one younger than 18 may see an 18 film in a cinema.

## Overview
The code is available to view in `control_flow.py` along with comments to walk you through the code!

The code is based around the `while` loop which will keep the program running forever or until the user enters `exit` when `break` is used to exit the loop!
